This Quickstart guide shows how to set up a TypeDB database and run queries using
xref:manual::studio.adoc[TypeDB Studio].

include::home::overview.adoc[tag=rust-rewrite]

== Run TypeDB

To start TypeDB, select the TypeDB edition below and follow the instructions.

[tabs]
====
Cloud::
+
--
// tag::cloud-run[]
Log in to https://cloud.typedb.com/[TypeDB Cloud,window=_blank] and create a new deployment on the Deployments page.
// end::cloud-run[]

// tag::self-hosted-run[]
For self-hosted TypeDB Cloud installation and setup,
see the xref:install/cloud-self-hosted.adoc[Self-hosted deployment] page.
// end::self-hosted-run[]
--

Core::
+
--
TypeDB Core needs to be xref:home::install/core.adoc[installed] first.

include::home::install/core.adoc[tag=core-run]

====

[#_typedb_studio]
== Connect with TypeDB Studio
// tag::run_studio[]
TypeDB Studio is a standalone TypeDB Client with GUI that needs to be
xref:home::install/studio.adoc[installed] and launched separately from a TypeDB server.

Find the TypeDB Studio binary and run it.
Click btn:[Connect to TypeDB] on the right side of the top toolbar.
// end::run_studio[]
include::manual::studio.adoc[tag=connect_studio]

== Select a project folder

Select a xref:manual::studio.adoc#_select_a_project_directory[project directory]
to store project files by clicking either btn:[Open Project] in the *Project* panel or
image:home::studio-icons/project.png[] Open Project Directory button in the top toolbar.

[#_create_a_database]
== Create a new database

Create a database to play with:

. Click the database icon (image:home::studio-icons/database.png[]) in the top toolbar.
. Enter a name for a new database, for example, `typedb-1`, and click btn:[Create].
. Select the new database from the dropdown to the right of the database icon.

[#_define_a_schema]
== Define a schema

A new database needs a schema before we can load any data:

. Ensure the Session toggle (`schema` / `data`) is set to `schema` and
  the Transaction toggle (`write` / `read`) is set to `write`.
. Open a new tab and copy-paste the following Define query:
+
[,typeql]
----
include::attachment$crash-course-schema.tql[]
----
. Click the image:home::studio-icons/run.png[Run query,width=9] btn:[Run Query] button.
. When the query has completed, click btn:[Commit Transaction] (image:home::studio-icons/commit.png[]).

Now that the schema has been defined, data can be inserted into the database.

[#_load_data]
== Load data

Now let's insert some sample data into the newly created database to be able to query in future steps:

. Ensure the Session toggle is set to `data` and the Transaction toggle is set to `write`.
. Open a new tab and copy-paste the following Insert queries:
+
[,typeql]
----
include::attachment$crash-course-data.tql[]
----
. Execute all queries in the file by clicking the image:home::studio-icons/svg/play-solid-green.svg[Run query,width=9]
btn:[Run Query] button.
. When the queries have completed, click btn:[Commit Transaction] (image:home::studio-icons/commit.png[]).

Assuming there were no errors in the process, the data is persisted in the database.

== Finish

Congratulations on completing the TypeDB quickstart guide!
Now you can try sending your first queries to the database.
We have prepared some simple <<_query_examples,query examples>> for you to try.

To learn about TypeDB's advanced and unique features such as
polymorphic queries,
type inference,
type inheritance,
rule-based reasoning,
and n-ary relations, we recommend you check the <<_learn_more>> section.

[#_query_examples]
== Query examples

Try sending the following queries:

* <<#_list_people>>
* <<#_get_query_all_instances_and_attributes>>
* <<#_fetch_all_emails_of_kevin>>
* <<#_insert_email_for_kevin>>
* <<#_update_email_for_kevin>>
* <<#_delete_email_from_kevin>>

//#todo Replace the link below with a more specific one in a TypeQL section. Query types?
For more TypeQL query examples, check the xref:home::25-queries.adoc[] page or the
xref:typeql:ROOT:overview.adoc[TypeQL] documentation section.


[#_list_people]
=== List names and emails

To retrieve full names and emails of all instances of the `person` type you can do:

[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person;
fetch $p: full-name, email;
----

For every person in a database,
the above xref:typeql::queries/fetch.adoc[Fetch] query returns a JSON object similar to the following example:

.Result example
[,js]
----
{
    "p": {
        "email": [ { "value": "kevin.morrison@typedb.com", "value_type": "string", "type": { "label": "email", "root": "attribute" } } ],
        "full-name": [ { "value": "Kevin Morrison", "value_type": "string", "type": { "label": "full-name", "root": "attribute" } } ],
        "type": { "label": "person", "root": "entity" }
    }
}
----

[#_get_query_all_instances_and_attributes]
=== Get all instances of a type and their attributes

To xref:typeql::queries/get.adoc[get] all instances of a `person` type with all attributes owned:

[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person, has $a;
get $p, $a;
----

The above xref:typeql::queries/get.adoc[Get] query returns concepts from a database as a ConceptMap
that can be used programmatically with a xref:drivers::overview.adoc#_typedb_drivers[Driver API] to process the result.

image::quickstart-get-example.png[Quickstart Get query example, role=framed, width = 75%, link=self]

[#_fetch_all_emails_of_kevin]
=== Fetch all emails of Kevin

To xref:typeql::queries/fetch.adoc[fetch] all emails
owned by every person with a full name that contains substring `Kevin`:

[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person, has full-name $fn;
$fn contains "Kevin";
fetch $p as person: email as "E-mail address";
----

The above query returns a single JSON object (we have only one such person in the example database)
that looks as the following:

.Result example
[,js]
----
{
    "person": {
        "E-mail address": [ { "value": "kevin.morrison@typedb.com", "value_type": "string", "type": { "label": "email", "root": "attribute" } } ],
        "type": { "label": "person", "root": "entity" }
    }
}
----

[#_insert_email_for_kevin]
=== Insert a new email for Kevin

To xref:typeql::queries/insert.adoc[insert] a new email (`kevin@gmail.com`) for every person with a full name
that contains "Kevin":

[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person, has full-name $fn;
$fn contains "Kevin";
insert $p has email "kevin@gmail.com";
----

Now Kevin has more than one email.

[#_update_email_for_kevin]
=== Update the email for Kevin

To xref:typeql::queries/update.adoc[update] the email from `kevin@gmail.com` to `kevin2@gmail.com`
for every person with a full name that contains "Kevin":

[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person,
    has full-name $fn,
    has email $e;
$fn contains "Kevin";
$e = "kevin@gmail.com";
delete
$p has $e;
insert
$p has email "kevin2@gmail.com";
----

The query above does the following:

- Matches the person and its email (`kevin@gmail.com`).
- Deletes the ownership by the person of the email.
- Inserts a new email (`kevin2@gmail.com`) owned by the person.

[#_delete_email_from_kevin]
=== Delete ownership over the email for Kevin

To xref:typeql::queries/delete.adoc[delete] the ownership of the email `kevin2@gmail.com`
for every person with a full name that contains "Kevin":

[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person,
    has full-name $fn,
    has email $e;
$fn contains "Kevin";
$e = "kevin2@gmail.com";
delete
$p has $e;
